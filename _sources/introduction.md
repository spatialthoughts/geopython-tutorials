## Before you begin

Each of the following tutorial is in form of a self-contained notebook and comes with step-by-step explanation and datasets. The preferred way to run each notebook is using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Click the icon <img src='images/fa-rocket.svg' height=15></a> located at the top of each tutorial to open it on Colab.
