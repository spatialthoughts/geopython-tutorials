# Geospatial Python Tutorials

Welcome to Spatial Analysis and Remote Sensing Tutorials by [Spatial Thoughts](https://spatialthoughts.com/). These tutorials complement our Python courses and are suitable for learners who want to advance their skills. 

We highly recommend completing the following courses before diving into these tutorials. All our courses are open-access and freely available for self-study.

* [Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html)
* [Mapping and Data Visualization with Python](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-dataviz.html)

## Before you begin

Each of the following tutorial is in form of a self-contained notebook and comes with step-by-step explanation and datasets. The preferred way to run each notebook is using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
